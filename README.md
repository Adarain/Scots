# Scots keyboard layout

This is a keyboard layout for the Scots language based on the English (UK) layout. A few symbols had to be moved to make place for special letters requried to write Scots according to the orthography made by Markas Ã“ Domhnaill. To take a look at the layout, open the scots.klc with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339).
